		"ItemTooltips"
		{
			"item_ghost"		"For heroes that rely on physical damage like Juggernaut (and Omnislash), Clinkz and Riki, Ghost Scepter can be a cheap option to delay their ganks and make them waste their abilities that do no damage."
			"item_cyclone"		"Euls Scepter of Divinity improves Leshracs key components to survive and deal damage: movement speed, mana regeneration.

With Euls, you can cast it then cast Split Earth or activate it on yourself while casting Diabolic Edict and Pulse Nova to safely dish out damage."
			"item_ultimate_scepter"		"Aghanims Scepter is a fantastic end-game item to disable physical enemy carries and amplify your damage. Especially strong if you have a great initiator like Enigma or your team mostly relies on magic AoE output."
			"item_black_king_bar"		"BKB is necessary for a hero that relies on not getting stunned or silenced to dish out the necessary damage."
			"item_veil_of_discord"		"Veil of Discord amplifies all your spells and helps your mana regen early on. It can be a great item to burst down enemies early on and works with everyone&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;apos;s spells."
			"item_glimmer_cape"		"Glimmer Cape may be ideal as a pinch item to escape, maneuver in fights while your Diabolic Edict and Pulse Nova go off or to save an ally. The versatility is innumerable, but it is not necessarily a good pick-up if the situation doesn&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;apos;t warrant it (ganks)."
			"item_force_staff"		"If targeted, distance or reposition yourself with Force Staff. Your abilities are best used in range so keeping a distance versus melee heroes is important."
			"item_sphere"		"Consider Linken&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;apos;s Sphere if specific ultimate, target abilities like stuns and silences are keeping you down. This should be seen different as Black King Bar because it will waste ultimate abilities on you like Doom&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;apos;s Doom or Necrophos&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;apos; Reaper Scythe from completely killing/disabling you."
			"item_rod_of_atos"		"Similar to Eul&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;apos;s Scepter of Divinity, Rod of Atos entraps foes for a period in time, long enough for your follow-up abilities or skill-shots.

Rely on Rod of Atos to set up a gank as its range is quite far."
			"item_lotus_orb"		"Lotus Orb provides the armor to give more survivability but also allows you dispel big stuns/slows or reflect back nuke damage on your teammates who keep getting targeted."
			"item_shivas_guard"		"Shivas Guard can be great if you have yourself being thrown in the middle of fights and want to keep foes close so you can destroy with Diabolic Edict and Pulse Nova."
			"item_aeon_disk"		"Aeon Disk helps you get out of a jam where you are constantly being chain-stunned or destroyed by abilities like Faceless Voids ultimate or PAs massive critical strikes."
			"item_eternal_shroud"		"Leshrac takes a lot of damage while being in the middle of a fight while also spending a lot of mana. Eternal Shroud can help repel off some of the damage you take from attacks while keeping you sustained!"
			"item_aghanims_shard"		"Aghs Shard is an incredible zoning tool and team-fighting mechanic that consistently provides value the longer the game goes. Try to cast your Split Earth in and around fights or at the entrance of your high-ground base to ensure the enemy is pressure to either commit or leave that area."
			"item_magic_wand"		"Opt for Magic Stick early if the enemy spam a lot of spells or youâ€™ll be in the lane significantly. Magic Wand can be bought as early as before Boots of Speed or as late as after your core Boots upgrade depending on how the enemy and their spell usage. Magic Wand can also be bought to make room for other items due to limited space."
			"item_branches"		"Iron Branch can be placed on the ground to then be consumed by on your tangos for additional healing."
			"item_kaya_and_sange"		"Kaya and Sange plays off Leshracs need to avoid being disabled for too long but also amplifies the mana regeneration he relies on to be able to maximize his spells value."
			"item_blink"		"Blink Dagger allows you to initiate on enemies with Split Earth before they can even react.

More importantly, you can use Blink Dagger to jump into fights at the most opportune time and activate all your AoE abilities like Pulse Nova and Diabolic Edict."
			"item_guardian_greaves"		"Greaves is to play off the extra survivability that Leshrac relies on as well as always being in and around fights to maximize his effectiveness."
			"item_null_talisman"		"An early Null Talisman provides just enough last-hitting power for you to last-hit comfortably while also giving you some breathing room in mana-pool and regen to use your spells consistently to last-hit the ranged creep, harass the enemy or alleviate dependency on Bottle or Soul Ring."
			"item_arcane_boots"		"Arcane Boots is most importantly used to give you the necessary mana to heavy use your spells and abilities. Consider disassembling them (right-click on the item and select disassemble) if youre building towards major items like Aether Lens or other. This will hasten your timing in reaching those items which should preserve your mana-pool sufficiently from there on."
			"item_bloodstone"		"Leshrac deals damage purely through his abilities, making this item an incredible survivability tool and mana-regeneration savior while in the heat of battle.

Be sure to activate this ability and BKB (if you bought it) while in the midst of a fight."
			"item_travel_boots"		"With your Arcane Boots disassembled and the pace at which Leshrac can clear lane creeps. Boots of Travel keeps you on the move, rotating to different lanes and can join any fight at any time."
			"item_ethereal_blade"		"Ethereal Blade is a great nuking component as an addition to your abilities. 

To add, it can also be used defensively to either disable physical carries from attacking or save an ally from being targeted by physical attacks."
			"item_octarine_core"		"For heroes who are dependent on their abilities to engage fights, Octarine Core is a great assistance, especially if you naturally build into it by having its components created earlier in the game."
			"item_sheepstick"		"Late in the game, Scythe of Vyse solves all your mana issues but more importantly guarantees to lock enemies down before they can even pop BKB. Its a great initiating tool when you know the enemy relies on BKB to safely output their damage."

1. Target a foe with Lightning Storm.
2. The slowed foe can then be stunned with Split Earth.
3. Stay on top of them with Pulse Nova and Edict.

Split Earth can be canceled mid-cast if the target moves. Use this ability and Pulse Nova to wipe quickly farm lane creeps."
			"leshrac_diabolic_edict"		"This ability can be used on towers, creeps and heroes. Keep your furthest distance when pushing towers to ensure the Edict only targets the tower.

Works on invisible units and continues to occur even when you die."
			"leshrac_lightning_storm"		"Lightning Storm is your lane harassment tool and soon after your initiation. Use Lightning Storm to slow foes, and then follow-up with Split Earth. 

Lightning Storm is also used to reach the range creep to last-hit."
			"leshrac_pulse_nova"		"Pulse Nova is your damage-deale that relies on you staying alive to maximize its value. Caution that it is a massive mana drain so be sure to keep up with different mana regeration items."
